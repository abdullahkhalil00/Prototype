### **5. Edit Popup Feature**

* When a user clicks the **Edit** button on a card:

  * Show a **popup window** divided into two sides:

    * **Left side:** Show the selected image live.

      * Saturation
      * Temperature
      * Contrast
      * Hue
      * Lightness
      * Color Model (dropdown)
  * As users adjust values, changes apply to the image in **real time**.
  * Below the image, display the **prompt** for that image.
  * Whenever the user changes any setting, update the prompt automatically by appending the new parameter and value.

**Example:**
Original prompt:
“A stylish man with dark, curly hair and a beard, wearing sunglasses, an olive green jacket over a black t-shirt, and light-colored pants, steps out of a white luxury car.”

If the user changes saturation to 0.8, update the prompt to:
“…luxury car. **Saturation = 0.8**”
If they also adjust hue or contrast, append each new value to the end of the prompt.
